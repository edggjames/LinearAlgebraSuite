# LinearAlgebraSuite

This folder contains code that I have written to implement an object oriented library for linear algebra in C++. It is divided into three
parts:
- Part 1 implements the Matrix class that provides the support for arbitrarily sized 2-D matrices, a.k.a. m-by-n matrices.
- Part 2 implements the	SquareMatrix class that extends the Matrix class to provide specialised support for square matrices,
 a.k.a. n-by-n matrices.
- Part 3 applies the implementaion to several important engineering problems.

NB - I did not author MatrixTest.cpp, and SquareMatrixTest.cpp was adapted from this file.
